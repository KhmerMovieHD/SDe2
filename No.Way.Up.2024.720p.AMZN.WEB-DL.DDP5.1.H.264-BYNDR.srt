-I'm sorry. Jules pulled out
of the trip, man.

15
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,973
-Hey, it never would have
worked out between us anyway.

16
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:48,460
Look at these amigos.
Fancy a little diving, dude?

17
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,048
-If I did that,
she's reconsider.

18
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:52,602
-That's what I like to hear.
-Huh?

19
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,433
It's a miracle
she's getting out of here.

20
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,435
Her daddy won't let her go
anywhere on her own.

-That is true.

Speak of the devil.

23
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:04,269
And who says chicks
don't know how to travel light?

25
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,206
Okay. Spoke too soon.

-Hey, honey.
-Jed.

27
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:16,937
You brought the babysitter?

28
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,284
-I heard that.

29
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:22,218
-Are you serious?
He's coming with us.

30
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,254
-Dad kind of insisted.

31
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,534
-We're going
to a resort in Cabo.

32
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,984
What does he think
you need a bodyguard for?

33
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,097
-Sorry.

34
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,273
-You, uh, like, gonna
scope the place out,

35
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,792
see who could be a terrorist?

36
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:47,933
-Every situation has
the potential for violence.

37
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:52,766
Here, it's virtually zero.

38
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,319
-Hmm.

39
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:55,872
-What about those guys, huh?

40
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,633
They look a little bit sus,
right?

41
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:59,428
-The guy with the long hair
behind me?

42
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:02,396
No. Pacifist musician.

43
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,398
The two bald dudes
with the tats,

44
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,193
coming in the door?

45
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:07,953
High-flying executives.

46
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:10,300
Look at their perfect hands.

47
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,682
The lady with the wiener dog?

48
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:16,065
Oh, I'd say she has
the potential to be violent,

49
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:19,171
but only to her husband.
Do you want me to go on?

50
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,552
No, sir.

51
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:23,313
-Ah.

52
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,454
-Ava, you can't expect
your family

53
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:26,834
to dictate your life forever.

54
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,698
It's just one trip.

55
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,907
I'll make sure he stays
in the background, I promise.

56
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,840
You'll barely see him.

57
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,223
-Sure.

58
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:39,399
It's your dad.

59
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:41,331
-He wants to wish you
a good trip.

60
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,023
-Sorry.

61
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,508
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
D-Don't worry, don't worry.

62
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:53,343
You'd sleep in that bloomin'
thing if I let you.

63
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,485
-I love this old cap.

64
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,556
If it wasn't for my time
in the army,

65
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,350
I'd have never met your Nana.

66
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,007
Mwah.
-Oh!

67
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,982
-What's wrong, Nana?
-Oh, nothing, dear.

68
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:15,676
As you grow up, you're becoming
more like your mum.

69
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,782
And that's a good thing.

70
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:20,785
It's a shame she and your dad
couldn't make it out here.

71
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,097
-Did I miss something?

72
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,859
-A couple of anniversaries
over the years.

73
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,826
But you know that.

74
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,173
-Oh, aren't you the funny one.

75
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,693
Oh, I'll meet you at the gate.

76
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:35,213
-Where are you going?

77
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,698
-Surprise!

78
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:39,976
-Oh, I like surprises.

79
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,028
-Together, we can do this.

80
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:03,413
-Yeah.
My father is the governor.

81
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,243
-Hey, he's got my vote.

82
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,245
-He's everywhere.

83
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:12,388
-I knew that shrapnel in my butt
would set the scanner alarm off.

84
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,805
-You know about my shrapnel,
don't you?

85
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,497
-I don't think
I've heard that story.

86
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,739
-Really?

87
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:21,328
You've told me a thousand times,
Grandpa.

88
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:22,881
Oh.

89
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,332
-You're dropping out?
Are you crazy?

90
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,127
-That's what I said.

91
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,888
-You can't give up law school
to intern at a fucking start-up.

92
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,994
-It's not a start-up.
-Dad's charity.

93
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:33,754
It'll be Fortune 500
in a couple of years.

94
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,204
-You don't even like computers.

95
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,931
You really want to be stuck
in a job you hate?

96
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,866
And what about your bar exams?

97
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,316
Or are you just
scared of failing?

98
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,422
-Maybe.
-Oh, hey, come on.

99
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,769
-I'm just not very good
under pressure.

100
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:51,945
-Look, maybe it's not
such a bad move.

101
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,326
I mean, lawyers
are all assholes anyway.

102
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,743
What? Mine didn't get me
off the rap.

103
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,089
Just took his fat fee.

104
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,298
-Kyle, you got caught
smoking weed in Walmart.

105
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:02,576
-Okay, I'm just saying,
if it had been Whole Foods,

106
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,129
no one would have cared.

107
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,028
-When will you learn
to believe in yourself?

108
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:09,134
-Look, I thought this was a
vacation, not an interrogation.

109
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,556
-The federal
transportation system...

110
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,143
-Good morning.
My name is Martina.

111
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:21,146
I'd like to welcome you aboard
flight 5073 to Charlotte.

112
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,632
Your carry-on allowance is
one carry-on bag

113
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,599
and one personal item.

114
00:09:25,703 --> 00:09:27,118
-What is it?

115
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,087
What, you lose something?

116
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:34,815
-Mr. Tibbs.
-Oh, no, Mr. Tibbs.

117
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,611
Rosa?

118
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,788
-Oh!
-Oh!

119
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,411
-Watch where you're going, kid!
-I just lost my teddy bear.

120
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:47,276
-And you've ruined my shawl!
-Sorry.

121
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,661
-Aww.

122
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,904
Where's Nana when you need her?

123
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,322
-Don't worry, honey,
we'll get you another one

124
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:02,705
if we can't find him?
Okay?

125
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,436
-Is this it?

126
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm sorry I was so rude.

127
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:16,270
I'm not much of
a morning person.

128
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,410
Where are you guys headed?

129
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:21,690
-Rosa's visiting from England,
and so we're taking her

130
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:24,106
to our timeshare in Cabo
for a week.

131
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,282
-Thank you
for finding Mr. Tibbs.

132
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,629
-No worries.

133
00:10:29,732 --> 00:10:30,699
I'll see you on the plane.

134
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,324
-Do you think I'm too old
to have a teddy?

135
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,293
-Hey, I'd want Mr. Tibbs with me
if I was in trouble.

136
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:45,230
You found a new admirer.

137
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:49,027
I remember when
you were that size.

138
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:54,136
Ava, do you really need me
in Cabo?

139
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,241
You're a big girl now.

140
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,140
-That's true.

141
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,452
But you've come
all the way here.

142
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,765
No worries.

143
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:04,802
Your dad pays me.

144
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:09,047
-It's just that I feel
kind of weird about today.

145
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:13,396
-Hey, you're gonna be okay
on this one.

146
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,053
I mean, you've got your friends.

147
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:16,814
I don't think
they're gonna miss me.

148
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:19,333
-You're right, but after
what happened with Mom.

149
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,266
The accident.

150
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:26,306
-I miss her, Ava.

151
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,204
I really do.

152
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,793
I still have nightmares
about it.

153
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,140
Wasn't your fault.

154
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:35,349
Things would have been different
if I'd been there.

155
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,317
She might never have drowned.

156
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,390
-I know it sounds kooky, but
I just like having you around.

157
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,220
-Well, if you'd feel more
comfortable me coming,

158
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:46,429
you just have to say.

159
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,092
Don't worry, I'll be discreet.

160
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,681
Your pals will hardly know
